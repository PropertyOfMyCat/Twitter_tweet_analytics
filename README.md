A simple script to generate graphs of interesting performance metrics. Go to Twitter Analytics and at the top of the screen, where it says,

We're working on improvements to analytics.twitter.com. In the meantime, you may see some metrics are missing. You can access your Tweet Analytics and download reports here. You can try the new version of account analytics beta here.
`

click on "here" after "download reports". Download your data (either activity by day or by tweet) and save it in a single directory with the default filename(s). Then run this script in a Jupyter Notebook.
